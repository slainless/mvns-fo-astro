        <Markdown>
          Profile displays information about your enrolled courses,
          certificates, orders, quizzes and wishlist. However, you cannot edit
          the information, unless the profile settings allows you to modify the
          following information such as your biographical info, first/last name,
          display name publicly, avatar and change password. It is highly
          recommended to change the aforementioned information on your
          **profile** instead of your **learning profile** under the Settings
          tab.

      <Accordion.Item title="What is the difference between Learning Profile and Profile?">
        <Markdown>
          The difference between learning profile and user profile is the level
          of information provided. For instance, on your profile page, you are
          allowed to change your profile details, connect with other registered
          users, attend forums, etc. However, learning profile is used to
          provide information about your learning experience.
