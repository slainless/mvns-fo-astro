          ## Privacy

          - When a student takes a class on mavens.live, we will share the student’s username and
            profile with the teacher for the purpose of teaching these students on Mavensdotlive.
          - By enrolling in a class on Mavensdotlive, a student grants to us permission to share
            that student’s information with the teacher. The teacher is required to respect the privacy
            of the student.
          - The teacher may use that personal information for no other purpose, such as sending unsolicited
            commercial messages or unauthorized transactions.
          - Without express consent from that person, you must not add any Mavensdotlive misuse of any
            student’s personal information.
          - Remember that you need to comply with all relevant legal rules when you use Mavensdotlive. This
            includes applicable data protection and privacy laws which govern the ways in which you can use
